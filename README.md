# FRIENDsite
A blog site dedicated to the TV series FRIENDS

this site would be attempted to be developed using the following stack:

- [fastify](https://www.fastify.io/)

- [polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/)

- and a database tech I am still finding

This is a fully experimental project in which I will do my best to research and document all my progress and methods

this is my first time attempting to develop a [fully stacked app](https://www.quora.com/How-do-front-end-and-back-end-technologies-work-together) where the frontend and backend frameworks are completely seperated from each other
