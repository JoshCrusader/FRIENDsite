# FRIENDsite
A blog site dedicated to the TV series FRIENDS

this site would be attempted to be developed using the following stack:

- [fastify](https://www.fastify.io/)

- [polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/)

- [firebase](https://howtofirebase.com/save-and-query-firebase-data-ed73fb8c6e3a)

This is a fully experimental project in which I will do my best to research and document all my progress and methods

this is my first time attempting to develop a [fully stacked app](https://www.quora.com/How-do-front-end-and-back-end-technologies-work-together) where the frontend and backend frameworks are completely seperated from each other 

My progress can be tracked [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TKRs93SieXNhXzQDoI-rlfpaZQc9OiihZJ3kkI8Apng/edit?usp=sharing)

to start:
```bash
# install dependencies
npm install
# begin backend server
node server
```
backend server should start at port 3000

Open another terminal
```bash
# Begin frontend server
cd Frontend
polymer serve
```
polymer server should start at port 8081
